We provide futuristic smart solutions.

Smart Testbed by Tech Phantoms.

We are providing an idea in a portable product for researchers and students which help them in various ways.It helps students to control their different smart home actuators, components and sensors within a single platform. As we know, air conditioning, entertainment systems, lighting systems, and smart devices are all smoothly incorporated into a typical smart house or educational institute. These devices communicate with one another using wireless technology. However, in order to set up a smart home environment, these networked gadgets must communicate with one another. Despite the fact that the smart home industry is still in its infancy, it is fast increasing. In such a case, we will present a smart house testbed concept known as "Smart TestBed". With all these things, we are providing an application through which students can control all these IOT actuators, components and sensors, and are also able to see how these IOT components are connected with each other.

##Grove Pi The Grove Pi makes connecting the Raspberry Pi to sensors and actuators quite simple as students do not need to consider circuit diagrams. Seeed Studios and Dexter Industries have some great code snippets and projects on their respective Githubs. This sample takes much of its Grove Pi code from those samples.

##Flask Flask is a great little Python Web Server, and is perfect for students because they are already programming Python on the Raspberry Pis. I like Flask better than Django because it clearly shows students url request handlers and the methods of sending or receiving data.
